Tools improving HubFlow

"git hf" is a Git extension to provide high-level repository operations 
for [DataSift's HubFlow branching model](http://datasift.github.com/gitflow/), which is based on [Vincent Driessenâ€™s original blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

##Actions

  * "git hf feature rstart" also assigned this issue to user

2. Extend "git hf feature finish" to close related issue (ussing branch name **&lt;issue_number&gt;**-&lt;issue_title&gt;-&lt;user&gt;)
